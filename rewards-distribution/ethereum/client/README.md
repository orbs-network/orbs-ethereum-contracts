# Rewards Distribution using OrbsRewardsDistribution contract

Used as an infrastructure to distribute rewards, it will
* Take as an input a csv file holding address and amount (in full orbs) to distribute to
* Create batches of distribution to update the contract with
* Distribute after batches has been set up

In order to use it, you will first need to
* Have the address of a deployed `OrbsRewardsDistribution` contract. The mainnet address is [0xB52daF3f853bF570814d6AeA1ec7BFF30339BD0c](https://etherscan.io/address/0xb52daf3f853bf570814d6aea1ec7bff30339bd0c)
   - Previous distribution contract (non-staking) was at [0xb2969e54668394bca9b8af61bc39b92754b7a7a0](https://etherscan.io/address/0xb2969e54668394bca9b8af61bc39b92754b7a7a0)
* Have a csv file with the distribution details
* Have the distribution event name
* Create a new wallet (mnemonic) for executing the batches
  * Do that in myCrypto, create new wallet with mnemonic, and **use the first address of that new wallet**.
* Run `npm install` at the `rewards-distribution/ethereum` root. This will set up truffle for you (but you still need to configure it)
* Ensure that the `truffle-config.js` is configured:
  * The gas price at the `networks: mainnet:` part should be relevant for immediate execution of the transactions, check gas prices first. 
* Ensure that all environment variables are valid:
  * `MAINNET_SECRET` for a mnemonic for the wallet to be used for batch distribution, the first address of that wallet will be used.
  * `MAINNET_URL` for a valid ethereum endpoint (infura is okay)
  * To set up the varilables, run:
    * `export MAINNET_SECRET="a b c ..."` - replace a b c ... with the mnemonic
    * `export MAINNET_URL=https://[ethereum_node_address]` - replace [ethereum_node_address] with the url you got from infura
* Working in batches of 50, a full batch will cost ~2.2M gas - at 5 gwei this will be about 0.3 ETH for 30-35 batches of 50 size (or 1500-1700 address to distribute to)
  -- at 200 gwei a single batch will cost about 0.5 ETH, so for 20 txns it's 10 ETH
* When registering the batches ('announceDistributionEvent') use a high gas limit of 1M gas
* When sending the batches ('executeCommittedBatch') use a high gas limit of 2.5M gas



## Creating the batches
To begin working, in a terminal, navigate to the root of truffle project under `rewards-distribution/ethereum`
You will need to then execute the batch generation script:
```$bash
./node_modules/.bin/truffle exec client/getBatchHahses.js  [csv filename] [number of payments per batch] --network mainnet
```

* We usually use 50 as number of payments per batch

The CSV filename should have two columns: address, total_rewards
The result will be output of this kind:
```
➜  ethereum git:(rewards-distribution) ✗ truffle exec client/getBatchHahses.js  ~/Downloads/distribution-1-27.csv 50
Using network 'development'.

usage: truffle exec getBatchHashes.js [rewards csv file] [batchSize]
parsing file /Users/ron/Downloads/distribution-1-27.csv into batches of up to 50 payments each
total rewards amount: 18018788000000000000000000
# rewards: 1513
# batches: 31

* The generation script may need to be terminated with ctrl+c if it does not return to prompt after calculation is done.
* Review total amounts, number of batches and rewards, and sample rows, the filename parsed, etc. Do that by checking that the addresses in the batches are exactly the same as in the CSV - this is a basic sanity test. Note that output starts for 0, so the row in the csv (starting for 1) is the same as the one in the script because the csv has headers
* Transfer `total rewards amount` orbitons to the address of `OrbsRewardsDistribution` contract - remember to check network congestion and ensure the gas price is high enough for the transfer to go through in a timely manner
* Send a transaction to `OrbsRewardsDistribution.announceDistributionEvent` 
  * The ABI is: `[{"constant":false,"inputs":[{"name":"_distributionEvent","type":"string"},{"name":"_batchHashes","type":"bytes32[]"}],"name":"announceDistributionEvent","outputs":[],"payable":false,"stateMutability":"nonpayable","type":"function"}]`
  * Only the contract owner can do that
  * Switch off automatic gas calculation if using MyCrypto. This transaction can cost up to 1.5M gas, use a high gas limit, with a gas price that will be executed 'now' according to congestion.
  * Provide the following parameters:
    * distributionName - name to appear in event logs relating to payments in current distribution, this is used later to execute the batches
    * batchHashes - the array output by `getBatchHashes` under the `batch hashes` section, copy paste that from the script output.
  * Check the transaction status to ensure the batches were registered with the account.

## Executing the batches

After the transactions are committed, run batch execution script. Make sure your truffle networks are configured and that any required environment variable is set:
```$bash
./node_modules/.bin/truffle exec client/executeBatches.js [rewards contract address] [rewards csv file] [batchSize] [distribution event name] --network mainnet
```

* Contract address is the one for `OrbsRewardsDistribution` where the batches were set. The mainnet address is [0xB52daF3f853bF570814d6AeA1ec7BFF30339BD0c](https://etherscan.io/address/0xb52daf3f853bf570814d6aea1ec7bff30339bd0c) 
  - Old address [0xb2969e54668394bca9b8af61bc39b92754b7a7a0](https://etherscan.io/address/0xb2969e54668394bca9b8af61bc39b92754b7a7a0)
* The CSV file is the same as the one used for generating the batches
* The batch size is the same as used when generating
* The distribution event name must be the same as used when setting the batches into the contract

Before executing the batches, pay attention to:
* Use a new wallet (nmemonic) (The environment variable MAINNET_SECRET)
* Each batch of 50 will cost about 1.1M gas
* Ensure that there is enough ether in the account executing the batches (it will be a lot of gas 'burned')

Typical output will be:
```

```

Note that the results array may contain errors as well as success objects

* In case there is a problem and the execution fails mid-way, the contract knows how to recover, simply re-run the execution and it will no re-send what was successfully sent.
