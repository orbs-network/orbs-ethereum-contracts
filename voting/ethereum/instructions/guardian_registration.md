## Guardian Registration
In order to participate in the voting, a Guardian must first register. 
An Orbs Guardian is identified and delegated to by her Ethereum address. 

This document walks you through the registration process of Guardians using the MyCrypto desktop wallet application.
Any wallet software may be used, and the choice of MyCrypto here is for illustration only.

### A Guardian registration requires to following data:
- Name and website URL of the Guardian

Note: A Guardian may update her registration data at any time or leave the registry.


### Registration pre-requirements
 - MyCrypto desktop app (or another equivalent wallet software)
 - A wallet setup with your Guardian's Ethereum account keys with a positive Ether balance for fees
 - ABI and contract address available on Etherscan. For example, on Ropsten testnet the contract may be found [here][1] 
 - 1 Ether deposit required to resgister as a Guardian
 - Registration data

### Registration steps

1. **Verify you are on the correct network** ([Choosing the relevant Ethereum Network](./choosing_the_network.md))
2. Navigate to *Contracts*, under the *Interact* tab.

1. Proceed to *Select an Address*. Select your Guardians's Ethereum address. 
The address you choose will be the Guardians's identification for purpose
 of delegation later on.

Click *Unlock*
1. After unlocking an account, a new field labeled *Value* will appear after the website entry field (see below).
Enter `1` in the *Value* field. This will send 1 Ether with your registration request as a deposit. `OrbsGuardian` contract
will refund you the deposit if you later request to unregister.
A 1 Ether deposit is required for registration. You may not send more than exactly 1 Ether.

1. Verify that the option *Automatically Calculate Gas Limit* is switched off, and manually adjust the *Gas Limit* field as required. `500,000` will be more than enough (at the time this is being written a successful registration uses ~115000 Gas).

##### Notes
* The contract does not enforce uniqueness of name and website values between the different Guardians. Two Guardians may register with same name, or website url. It is up to the Delegators to vet their Guardians. 
* To make changes to your registration repeat the process providing new values. A deposit is not required when re-registering. If you send a second deposit the transaction will revert.
* To to be removed from the Guardians list, use the leave() function.
  * Upon leave() the 1 Ether deposit is transferred back to the Guardian address.
