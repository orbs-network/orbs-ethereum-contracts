      Acting as a Guardian requires continuous monitoring and participation in
      the Orbs network. Delegators Token holders may choose to participate as
      Guardians or select a Guardian to empower with their voting weight.
      Delegating the voting weight to an active Guardian increases the networkâ€™s
      security by enabling the weight of the honest, silent majority to impact
      the network. The voting weight of each Delegator is equal to the balance
      of their ORBS tokens at the time of each election. In order to participate
      as a Delegator, a token holder must have at least 10,000 ORBS tokens in
      its balance at the time of the election event.

    <Typography paragraph variant="h6" color="textPrimary">
      It is important for a Delegator to select an active Guardian, as the
      participation of the Guardian is required in order for the Delegator to
      participate and receive rewards. Moreover, Delegators are encouraged to
      delegate only to identified and reputable Guardians. A Delegator may trust
      another Delegator token holder with the selection of the Guardian,
      allowing the Guardian to receive the voting weight of the hierarchy of all
      Delegators behind it. A delegation may be modified at any time and
      persists unless modifiedotherwise remains as is.
